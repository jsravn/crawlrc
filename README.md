# Crawl starter kit

[crawl](http://crawl.develz.org) defaults are generally pretty good.
This kit contains my personal tweaks which you may find helpful.

# Nice term fonts/colours

crawlterm is a bash script which starts up a terminal for playing
console crawl. Requires rxvt-unicode and DejaVu fonts.

# crawl bots

The best source for information are the crawl bots, located at
`##crawl` on `irc.freenode.net`.

## irssi

[crawl-botmsg.pl](http://voyager.lupomesky.cz/crawl/irssi-colorizer/)
is an irssi plugin to add color highlighting and formatting to the
crawl bots. I made some minor changes to prevent it crashing irssi on
buffer playback.

## hexchat

[softignore](https://github.com/jsravn/softignore) plugin can be used
to dim bot messages.
